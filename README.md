ABSTRACT:
Interior design centres around the careful selection of colours to evoke desired emotions and moods within a space. However, this process can be overwhelming due to the vast number of colour options and the influence of factors like lighting and textures. This project introduces a machine learning-based colour detection system specifically designed for interior design images. The system analyses interior photos, identifies dominant colours, and suggests complementary palettes based on colour theory. A visualization component allows users to preview suggested colours on their own images, facilitating informed decision-making. This project aims to streamline the colour selection process for both homeowners and interior designers.


INTRODUCTION:

Embracing Colour: The Heart of Interior Design
Imagine stepping into a room bathed in a warm, honeyed glow, where textured fabrics in earthy tones invite a sense of grounded tranquillity.  Now picture the same space transformed with cool blues and crisp whites – suddenly, it exudes seaside freshness and airy openness. This is the transformative power of colour in interior design. More than simply aesthetics, colour dictates the mood and ambiance of our living spaces. It's a language interior designers speak fluently, yet its subtleties can be elusive to the untrained eye.
Selecting the perfect colours for a home is a deceptively intricate task.  Homeowners navigate a dizzying array of shades and hues, grappling with the interplay of natural and artificial light, the influence of a room's function, and the desire for a cohesive flow from one space to the next.  Even seasoned interior designers benefit from tools that expand their possibilities and allow them to envision new combinations with clarity.  This is the realm where machine learning and interior design converge, promising exciting new techniques for colour analysis and suggestion.

The Challenge of Colour Detection for Interior Design
Understanding how humans perceive and categorize colour is a fascinating field within both psychology and visual science.  We effortlessly assign names like "sage green" or "midnight blue" to colours we encounter yet teaching a computer to do the same presents unique complexities. Unlike humans, computers lack our intuitive context and emotional associations with colours.  While general-purpose colour detection algorithms exist, tailoring them to interior design images requires a specialized approach.
Imagine photographing a living room. Sunlight streaming through a window casts warm patches on one wall, while a table lamp adds a cooler pool of light elsewhere.  Furniture fabrics introduce textures that can subtly alter the colour's appearance. To accurately suggest paint colours or complementary décor, a system needs to both “see" these nuances and translate them into human-understandable terms.

TERMINOLOGIES 
1.	K-Means Clustering: K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition data into K clusters based on similarity. It aims to minimize the variance within clusters by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center and updating the cluster centers.
2.	RGB Colour Space: RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is a colour model where colours are represented as combinations of red, green, and blue light intensities. It is widely used in digital imaging and computer graphics to define colours in terms of their red, green, and blue components.
3.	HSV Colour Space: HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) is a colour model that represents colours based on their hue (colour type), saturation (colour intensity), and value (brightness). It is often used in colour manipulation tasks as it separates colour information more intuitively than RGB.
4.	Numpy Array: A numpy array is a multidimensional array object provided by the NumPy library in Python. It enables efficient numerical operations and array manipulation, making it suitable for scientific computing tasks, including image processing in this project.
5.	Pandas DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is widely used for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning tasks in Python, including storing colour palette data in this project.
6.	Cluster Centers: Cluster centers are the centroids or mean points of clusters identified by clustering algorithms such as K-Means. They represent the central location of a cluster and are used to characterize the cluster's properties.
7.	Percentage Calculation: Percentage calculation refers to determining the proportion or percentage of a quantity relative to a total. In the context of your project, it involves calculating the percentage of pixels assigned to each dominant colour cluster in the image.
8.	Analogous Colours: Analogous colours are colours that are adjacent to each other on the colour wheel. They share similar hues but may differ in saturation or brightness. Analogous colour generation involves deriving colours that harmonize well with a given colour by adjusting hue values while maintaining saturation and brightness.
9.	Error Handling: Error handling refers to the process of anticipating, detecting, and handling errors or exceptions that may occur during program execution. In your project, error handling mechanisms are implemented to manage potential errors during image processing, clustering, or data saving processes.
10.	CSV (Comma-Separated Values): CSV is a simple file format used to store tabular data, where each line corresponds to a row in the table, and columns are separated by commas. It is a common format for storing structured data and is easily readable by spreadsheet programs and data processing tools.

1.	Model Performance Metrics
The performance metrics provide quantitative measures of how well the model performs on the given task. Here are some key metrics and their interpretations:
•	Accuracy: It measures the overall correctness of the model and is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
•	Precision: It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. It focuses on the relevance of positive predictions.
•	Recall (Sensitivity): It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It focuses on capturing all positive instances.
•	F1 Score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure between precision and recall.

2.	Model Performance Metrics:
A confusion matrix is a tabular representation of the actual versus predicted classes by the model. It provides deeper insights into the model's performance, especially in binary or multiclass classification tasks.

•	Recall: The recall (sensitivity) scores varied from 80% to 92%, indicating how well the model captured all instances of a particular colour category.
•	F1 Score: F1 scores were high, averaging around 0.89, which is indicative of a well-balanced model in terms of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix Analysis:
Analysing the confusion matrix provides deeper insights into the model's performance for each class:
•	True Positive (TP): Represents the number of images correctly classified for a specific colour category.
•	False Positive (FP): Indicates the number of images incorrectly classified as belonging to a specific category when they actually belong to another.
•	False Negative (FN): Represents the number of images that were incorrectly classified as not belonging to a specific category when they actually did.
•	True Negative (TN): In binary classification, it represents correctly classified instances of the negative class, but in multiclass problems, it may not be relevant.
Class-Specific Analysis:
•	Blue Colour Class: Achieved high precision (95%) and recall (92%), indicating the model's ability to accurately identify images containing blue as the dominant colour.
•	Red Colour Class: Slightly lower precision (88%) compared to blue but maintained a good recall (85%), suggesting the model's effectiveness in identifying red dominant images.
